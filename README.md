# Software_Engineering_EMS_Project

Our project for Software Engineering. In this project, we worked in a group to create a simplistic representation of an electronic medical service.
This application contains a login screen and four views.


 - Patient View: The patient portal where a patient can view their information.

 - Receptionist View: A view that allows a receptionist to add or remove appointments for patients, and sign in patients who have come for their appointments.

 - Nurse View: A view to allow nurses to quickly view a patients information and make note of any additional information.

 - Doctor View: A view to allow a doctor to view patient information and add to it, including adding new prescriptions.


I personally worked on the receptionist view.
